/*
** LIBRARY: <string.h>
** SYNOPSIS: size-bounded string copying
**
** DESCRIPTION:
** 		The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions copy and concatenate strings
**	respectively.  They are designed to be safer, more consistent, and less
**	error prone replacements for strncpy(3) and strncat(3).  Unlike those
**	functions, strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size of the buffer (not
**	just the length) and guarantee to NUL-terminate the result (as long as
**	size is larger than 0 or, in the case of strlcat(), as long as there is
**	at least one byte free in dst).  Note that you should include a byte for
**	the NUL in size.  Also note that strlcpy() and strlcat() only operate on
**	true ``C'' strings.  This means that for strlcpy() src must be NUL-termi-
**	nated and for strlcat() both src and dst must be NUL-terminated.
** 		The strlcpy() function copies up to size - 1 characters from the NUL-
**	terminated string src to dst, NUL-terminating the result.
